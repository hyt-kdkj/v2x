ns-3 Netsimulyzer Module Documentation
======================================

This is the documentation for the ns-3 companion module to the
`NetSimulyzer <https://github.com/usnistgov/NetSimulyzer>`_ application.

The application is an offline playback tool to display scenarios in 3D much like
`NetAnim <https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/NetAnim>`_. Not only may topology features,
such as Nodes and Buildings, be displayed, but additional items to further
understanding of the scenario, such as marked areas, a logging system
and charting are included as well.

The application replays a *ns-3* scenario after it has been run using a
JSON file which is generated by this module, and then loaded into the application.

Below is a screenshot of a simple scenario loaded into the application.
